<div class="line">Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms</div>

<div class="line">hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering</div>
<div class="line">the additional rights described in Section 3.5.</div>

<div class="line">an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution</div>
<div class="line">Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;</div>

<div class="line">initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a</div>
<div class="line">subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made</div>
<div class="line">available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that</div>
<div class="line">the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic</div>
<div class="line">Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</div>

<div class="line">code distribution titled &#8220;LEGAL&#8221; which describes the claim and</div>
<div class="line">the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient</div>
<div class="line">will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You</div>
<div class="line">make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You</div>
<div class="line">shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make</div>
<div class="line">available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying</div>

<div class="line">Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not</div>
<div class="line">possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to</div>
<div class="line">its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such</div>
<div class="line">as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for</div>
<div class="line">such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,</div>
<div class="line">warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more</div>
<div class="line">recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own</div>
<div class="line">behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any</div>
<div class="line">Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,</div>
<div class="line">support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,</div>

</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</div>
<div class="line">You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the</div>
<div class="line">requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,</div>
<div class="line">and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of</div>
<div class="line">the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,</div>

<div class="line">obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included</div>
<div class="line">in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or</div>
<div class="line">collateral in which You describe recipients&#8217; rights relating to the</div>
<div class="line">Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered</div>
<div class="line">Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different</div>
<div class="line">from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms</div>
<div class="line">of this License and that the license for the Executable version does</div>
<div class="line">not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#8217;s rights in the Source</div>
<div class="line">Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Executable version under a different license You must</div>
<div class="line">make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License</div>
<div class="line">are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any</div>
<div class="line">Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and</div>
<div class="line">every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer</div>
<div class="line">or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">3.7. Larger Works.</div>
<div class="line">You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code</div>
<div class="line">not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger</div>
<div class="line">Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the</div>
<div class="line">requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</div>
<div class="line">If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this</div>
<div class="line">License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute</div>
<div class="line">or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License</div>
<div class="line">to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and</div>
<div class="line">the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL</div>
<div class="line">file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all</div>
<div class="line">distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by</div>
<div class="line">statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed</div>
<div class="line">for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</div>

<div class="line">5. Application of this License.</div>
